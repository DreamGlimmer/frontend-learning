  Data structures and algorithms help to improve problem-solving capabilities and to optimize the solutions.

  <summary>Tell me about different role structures in the company</summary>
  
  <br>
  
  Roles/designations vary from company to company. The expectations and skill set are almost the same as explained in the role guide. To make the progression/promotion process motivating for employees, companies also have multi-level roles (SDE1, 2, 3, 4, ...) with a shorter span for each role. Many companies also follow Junior and Senior roles, with higher roles being tech lead/staff engineer.

  - Team lead role is equivalent associate manager role or higher role, in which the expectation is to have excellent soft skills besides good technical knowledge. Most of the companies give this designation to a person who manages more than one person (need not be technical)

  <summary>I had only a few technical rounds in a company & there were no rounds as mentioned above!!!</summary>

  <br>
  
  Companies follow the interview structure which best suits them. And depending on various factors (previous interviews, offer acceptance, conversion ratio, etc.) They adjust the interview processes.

<details>
  <summary>Is it fine to move to a lower role than my current role while switching?</summary>

  <br>
  
  Roles/designations vary from company to company. If the opportunity and compensation match your needs, moving to such a role should not be a problem.
</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary>I went through many of these mentioned interview rounds in a company. I have done very well but did not hear anything back from them!!!</summary>

  <br>
  
  - Selection criteria depend on various factors such as technical skills, soft skills, interview rules, previous company, the reason for the switch, etc. Interviews in which you think you have performed well may not be what the company is thinking or the vacancies might have been filled by others.
  - That said, the candidate deserves to know the application status after completing the interview process. Unfortunately, many companies (even well-known) ignore communicating the result to the candidate if rejected.
  - It is good to drop a mail requesting the status of the interview and expect feedback. Instead of getting disappointed, consider it as an interview experience. It isn't recommended to post on social media to defame the company.

  <br>
  
  One of the below approaches you can follow
  - If you aim for a long term and have enough time, start learning the fundamentals i.e. HTML, CSS, JS. It can be taken up, parallelly along with your routine work. Create a learning roadmap for yourself. It is more academic and organized.
  - If you aim to improve your skills on what you are working on daily, you can explore & study the fundamentals as and when you face the challenges. It is a practical approach but has no roadmap and is unorganized.

  <br>
  
  A self-taught developer is someone who does not depend on one curriculum or instructor, instead gets ready to excel in the coding/programming skills by using free/paid resources. You can become one and be a competent frontend developer like others.
  <br>

  <summary>I can follow video tutorials & create projects. But on my own, I get completely stuck. Where am I going wrong?</summary>

  <br>
  
  It is a common problem with most of us. Video tutorials take a lot of effort and trials by experts. But these videos are then converted to tutorials which include only the functional code and happy flow. Hence, it feels easy to follow while watching. As a suggestion, follow these tutorials only to understand the concepts and practice the coding yourself. Also, you can switch to reading the books, which will give your brain more work and will help you to think more to understand & come up with solutions (though it is time consuming)

  - job openings for frontend are more than ever in the current market

  - frontend ecosystem is vast and mastering it might not be possible
