  <summary>What is the difference between UI Engineer and frontend developer?</summary>

  <summary>Tell me about different role structures in the company</summary>
  
  <br>
  
  Roles/designations vary from company to company. The expectations and skill set are almost the same as explained in the role guide. To make the progression/promotion process motivating for employees, companies also have multi-level roles (SDE1, 2, 3, 4, ...) with a shorter span for each role. Many companies also follow Junior and Senior roles, with higher roles being tech lead/staff engineer.

  <summary>I had only a few technical rounds in a company & there were no rounds as mentioned above!!!</summary>

<details>
  <summary>I went through many of these mentioned interview rounds in a company. I have done very well but did not hear anything back from them!!!</summary>

  <br>
  
  - Selection criteria depend on various factors such as technical skills, soft skills, current company, previous company, the reason for the switch, etc. Interviews in which you think you have performed well may not be what the company is thinking. 
  - That said, the candidate deserves to know the application status after completing the interview process. Unfortunately, many companies (even well-known) ignore communicating the result to the candidate if rejected.
  - It is good to drop a mail requesting the status of the interview and expect feedback. Instead of getting disappointed, consider it as an interview experience. It isn't recommended to post on social media to defame the company.

  <summary>I directly started learning frontend framework without good knowledge of fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS). What should I do now?</summary>

  <br>
  
  One of the below approaches you can follow
  - If you aim for a long term and have enough time, start learning the fundamentals i.e. HTML, CSS, JS. It can be taken up, parallelly along with your routine work. Create a learning roadmap for yourself. It is more academic and organized.
  - If you aim to improve your skills on what you are working on daily, you can explore & study the fundamentals as and when you face the challenges. It is a practical approach but has no roadmap and is unorganized.

  <summary>I can follow video tutorials & create projects. But on my own, I get completely stuck. Where am I going wrong?</summary>

  <br>
  
  It is a common problem with most of us. Video tutorials take a lot of effort and trials by experts. But these videos are then converted to tutorials which include only the functional code and happy flow. Hence, it feels easy to follow while watching. As a suggestion, follow these tutorials only to understand the concepts and practice the coding yourself. Also, you can switch to reading the books, which will give your brain more work and will help you to think more to understand & come up with solutions (though it is time consuming)
